  - excerpt: | 
      CyberColombia is a group of interdisciplinary professionals in industry, academia and 
      international entities interested in promoting the adoption of high-performance computing 
      technologies in Colombia to accelerate experimentation processes in different areas of 
      science (physics, mathematics, geosciences, computational biology) and industry 
      (big data, machine learning). In a similar way, we aim to promote cooperation between 
      academia, industry and international entities through research.
