intro: 
  - excerpt: |
     CyberColombia is a collaborative ecosystem of interdisciplinary professionals from industry, academia, 
     and international organizations, committed to advancing **High-Performance Computing (HPC),Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, 
     and emerging technologies to drive scientific and technological innovation in Colombia and Latin America.
     Our mission is to accelerate research and applied development in critical scientific domains—including physics, 
     mathematics, geosciences, computational biology, and industrial engineering—through advanced digital infrastructure 
     and AI-driven solutions. We focus on large-scale data analysis, machine learning, deep learning,
     and simulation-based science as core components of modern research workflows.
     As part of our strategic expansion, **Quantum Computing (QC)** has been incorporated as an emergency and high-priority area. 
     We aim to build national capabilities in this emerging field by developing foundational and applied training programs 
     that cover quantum theory, logic gates, quantum algorithms, and the use of accessible cloud-based quantum platforms.
     Through these efforts, CyberColombia seeks to foster the emergence of a Quantum Ecosystem, 
     actively connecting with local universities, research centers, and regional partners to build the next generation of quantum-aware scientists and engineers.

    excerpt: |
      CyberColombia actively supports and promotes scientific workshops that foster collaboration among 
      multiple countries and agencies, with a strong focus on Latin America. These workshops serve as 
      platforms for knowledge exchange, capacity building, and joint development in fields such as scientific 
      computing, high-performance computing (HPC), and emerging digital technologies. By connecting researchers, 
      academic institutions, and government entities across borders, CyberColombia strengthens regional cooperation, 
      facilitates access to advanced computational resources, and promotes the co-creation of solutions to shared 
      scientific and technological challenges. This collaborative ecosystem accelerates innovation and builds 
      a more integrated and competitive scientific community in the region.
