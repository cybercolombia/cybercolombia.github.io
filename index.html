intro: 
  - excerpt: | 
      Cybercolombia aims to cultivate and foster the use of digital infrastructure for compute- and data-intensive analysis in Colombia. 
      This infrastructure includes the use of High-Performance Computers (HPC), and emerging processing infraestructures. 
      We also make a great effort in the establishment of collaborations and virtual organizations around common practices, tools, and data.
      Our approach is based on the development of annual *summer schools* and *technical talks* conducted by invited experts.

        In our 3rd Summer School Mateo Valero (BSC) tell to us how future computing ecosystems development will
        be driven by open technology due to the technology trends, costs, and ubiquitous 
        open source software.
