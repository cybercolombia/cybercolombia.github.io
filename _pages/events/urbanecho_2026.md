### Introduction

The workshop is designed to bridge academic research and real-world urban decision-making. It combines a structured technical introduction with a guided co-creation session, allowing participants to move from urban challenges to concrete research and prototyping ideas.

### Workshop structure (4 hours): 

### Part 1 – Technical talk and live demo (approx. 2 hours) 
This first block introduces the fundamentals of agent-based modeling and digital twins as tools to study complex urban systems. We will present how these approaches are currently used in urban research and policy  contexts, and walk through UrbanEcho’s platform and previous cases as examples.

### Part 2 – Guided brainstorming and research design (approx. 2 hours)
In the second half, participants organized in mixed groups (academia, transport, water, security, planning), will bring concrete urban issues or research questions they are interested in addressing. With guidance from the UrbanEcho team, each group will work on translating those issues into modelable research problems: defining agents, data needs, scenarios, and outcome metrics. The session closes with a plenary discussion to identify promising ideas and possible next steps toward pilot studies or applied research projects.
