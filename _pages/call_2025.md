**Call for Participation: 8th Edition of HPC Summer School by CyberColombia**

We are excited to announce the 8th Edition of the HPC Summer School, organized by CyberColombia. This in-person event will take place in various cities across Colombia between **June and July 2025** and is tailored for professionals and students in engineering, science, and technology fields who are eager to advance their knowledge in **High-Performance Computing (HPC)** and **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**. 

The HPC Summer School provides an immersive learning experience, equipping participants with cutting-edge tools and techniques to solve large-scale problems in academic and industrial settings. This year, we are expanding our program to cover **AI**, with a focus on **Deep Learning** and **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, alongside exploring new hardware architectures such as **Cerebras, SambaNova, Graphcore and Groq**—specialized platforms revolutionizing AI inference.

### **Scope and Objectives**
The aim of the HPC Summer School is to provide participants with the fundamental knowledge required to develop efficient parallel applications and enhance their understanding of HPC. In addition to HPC topics, participants will explore the role of AI in scientific computing and how emerging hardware solutions are reshaping the way we approach **LLMs** and **Deep Learning**. 

The program encourages participants to engage with peers and experts in the field, fostering collaboration and innovation. We believe in building a strong community that will support local and regional development through scientific and technological advancements.

### **What You Should Know**
The HPC Summer School is designed for individuals with basic to intermediate programming skills. Knowledge of **C and Fortran** is recommended, as these languages are essential for high-performance computing. Participants should be familiar with data types, pointers, and vectors, while prior experience with parallel programming is desirable.

This edition also emphasizes **AI technologies**. Familiarity with **Python** is expected, as it will be central to practical exercises in developing high-performance algorithms and deploying **AI models** on advanced platforms like Cerebras, SambaNova, and Groq.

Participants will have the opportunity to develop, profile, and optimize their own algorithms, learning how to solve complex problems efficiently in both HPC and AI contexts.

### **What You Will Learn**
At the conclusion of this program, participants will gain:
- **Expertise in Parallel Programming**: Master techniques for efficiently parallelizing tasks and optimizing code for HPC environments.
- **Code Profiling and Optimization**: Learn how to profile your algorithms to detect bottlenecks and enhance computational performance.
- **AI with Advanced Hardware Architectures**: Discover how new platforms like Cerebras, SambaNova, and Groq are revolutionizing AI inference and LLM deployment, and learn to leverage them in your projects.
- **High-Performance Python**: Integrate Python with high-performance computing environments to solve big data and large-scale problems across industries.

### **Why Participate?**
The HPC Summer School is not just about learning technical skills—it is also about building a network of interdisciplinary professionals. You will engage with experts and peers from various fields, creating opportunities for collaboration and innovation. Together, we can build a robust community of HPC and AI professionals to drive forward scientific and technological development in Colombia and the region.

### **Who Should Attend?**
This program is ideal for:
- Students and professionals in science, engineering, and technology with basic to intermediate skills in **C, Fortran, or Python**.
- Individuals interested in applying HPC and AI technologies to solve large-scale challenges in fields such as **physics, mathematics, geosciences, computational biology, big data, and machine learning**.
- Those who want to explore new AI hardware architectures and deepen their understanding of **LLMs** and **Deep Learning**.
