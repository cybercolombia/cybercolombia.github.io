### Introduction
Extreme weather and climate hazard forecasting plays a fundamental role in mitigating climate risks across Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), a region disproportionately affected by climate change. Increasingly frequent hydrometeorological hazards—including extreme temperatures, droughts, storms, hurricanes, and floods, confirm the urgency of accurate information and predictive tools. However, historical challenges such as fragmented observational networks and limited regional collaboration have hampered progress in developing tailored forecasting models and leveraging high-performance computing (HPC) solutions for climate and atmospheric research.

In the meantime, the international community is moving from current-generation modeling tools (e.g., the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model) to next-generation models that can take advantage of modern HPC systems (e.g., the Model for Prediction Across Scales - Atmosphere (MPAS-A). Furthermore, as AI and ML advance their capabilities and are increasingly adopted, questions remain regarding the convergence between weather forecasting and these technologies.

### Biography of comittee

Saulo R. Freitas is a researcher specializing in meteorology and atmospheric sciences. He holds a D. Sc. in Applied Physics from the University of São Paulo. Additionally, he conducted postdoctoral research at the NASA Ames Research Center and served as a Visiting Researcher at the Earth System Laboratory Research (NOAA). Currently, he is a Senior Researcher and Professor in the Graduate Program in Meteorology at the Brazilian Institute for Space Research (INPE). His research focuses on air pollution and atmospheric chemistry associated with wildfires, convection parameterization, and numerical weather forecasting integrated with atmospheric chemistry and aerosols.

Michael Duda is a Software Engineer in the Mesoscale and Microscale Meteorology Laboratory at the U.S. National Science Foundation National Center for Atmospheric Research (NSF NCAR). He has over a decade of experience working with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model software, and he is one of the principal developers of the WRF Pre-processing System, which he also maintains and supports to the user community. Michael is one of the primary architects of the Model for Prediction Across Scales (MPAS) software framework and infrastructure, and more recently, his work has focused on the computational performance of the atmosphere component of MPAS. He is particularly interested in extensible software design and algorithms of all sorts. Michael holds an M.S. in Computer Science from the University of Colorado.

Dr. Arlene Laing is the Coordinating Director of the Caribbean Meteorological Organization (CMO), a specialized agency of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) that coordinates joint scientific and technical activities in weather, climate and water-related sciences in 16 English-speaking Caribbean countries. Dr. Laing is a member of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Executive Council, Research Board, and Panel on Socio-economic Benefits.  She is known for studying tropical and mesoscale meteorology; large thunderstorm systems; flash floods and mitigation; satellite meteorology; lightning and El Niño; tropical cyclone rainfall and genesis; weather, climate, and meningitis; climate and armed conflict; and volcanic ash fall modelling. She is the lead author of “Introduction to Tropical Meteorology”, a peer-reviewed online textbook used globally. She is also a co-author and Editorial Committee member of the award-winning, “Meteorology of Tropical West Africa; The Forecasters’ handbook”.  In 2021, she was recognized as a 125th Anniversary Fellow by the College of Earth and Mineral Sciences of The Pennsylvania State University. The CMO is an admitted Inter-Governmental Organization of the UNFCCC.

Katherine Rasmussen is a Computer Systems Engineer who applies Linguistics knowledge to developing, testing, and compiling programming languages for high-performance computing. She has experience in language grammars and abstract syntax trees (ASTs) and works with Fortran, C, and C++. She works in the Computer Languages and Systems Software (CLaSS) Group at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory where she contributes to the Julienne unit-testing and string-handling utility, the LLVM Flang Fortran compiler, and the Caffeine parallel runtime library. She also does software archaeology, digging through layers of legacy code for purposes of modernization, porting, building, testing, and parallelization. She serves as an alternate on the Fortran Standards committee, has experience organizing the Fortran Standards committee meetings and is the co-Publication chair for CARLA2025, the Latin America High Performance Conference.

Dr. Jose Manuel Monsalve Diaz obtained his bachelor’s degree in Electrical Engineering from the Pontificia Universidad Javeriana in Bogotá in 2013, and his Master in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Delaware in 2020. After graduation in 2013, he continued his studies at the University of Delaware where he is currently pursuing his PhD on the area of Parallel Computing Architectures. He is also a graduate researcher in Argonne National Laboratory since 2018. Throughout the years he has worked as a research assistant of the CAPSL research group for Prof Guang. R. Gao, and the CRPL research group for Prof. Sunita Chandrasekaran. His areas of interest are parallel computer architecture design, parallel computer systems and parallel programming models. He has worked on validation and verification of OpenMP target offloading, as well as with OpenACC programming targetting CPU and heterogeneous systems based on GPGPUs

Dr. Esteban Hernandez, hold a PhD on Engineering with focus on HPC for Weather Forecasting. Senior Software architect with +17 years of experience, my strengths include a deep understanding of availability, performance, security, and capacity planning. I also have a deep understanding of and experience working with Big Data environments using Data Sciences tools and techniques. He has developed generations of high availability architectures based on open source software with JBoss, Glassfish and Apache Tomcat, tuned computing platforms to achieve high processing performance and implemented scientific programs using OpenMP, MPI, CUDA, OpenCL and OpenACC, and other parallel frameworks and languages. Dr. Hernandez has working as Senior Big Data Architect on AWS and HPC, Expert and currently Working as Senior Expert on Mercadolibre Colombia, currently is the executive director of SCALAC
