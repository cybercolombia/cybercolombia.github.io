### Introduction

This workshop is part of [CARLA 2025 conference](https://carlaconference.org/) and all details are now on [CARLA 2025 workshop website](https://carlaconference.org/lac-weather-forecasting-workshop/)

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Extreme weather and climate hazard forecasting plays a fundamental role in mitigating climate risks across Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), a region disproportionately affected by climate change. Increasingly frequent hydrometeorological hazards—including extreme temperatures, droughts, storms, hurricanes, and floods, confirm the urgency of accurate information and predictive tools. However, historical challenges such as fragmented observational networks and limited regional collaboration have hampered progress in developing tailored forecasting models and leveraging high-performance computing (HPC) solutions for climate and atmospheric research.

In the meantime, the international community is moving from current-generation modeling tools (e.g., the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model) to next-generation models that can take advantage of modern HPC systems (e.g., the Model for Prediction Across Scales - Atmosphere (MPAS-A). Furthermore, as AI and ML advance their capabilities and are increasingly adopted, questions remain regarding the convergence between weather forecasting and these technologies.

### Workshop Keynote Talks

Keynote: The pressing climate emergency and the imperative to advance climate modeling
Saulo R. Freitas
Talk Description: This talk introduces the MONAN program (Model for Ocean-laNd-Atmosphere predictioN), a Brazilian community program led by the National Institute for Space Research (INPE) that proposes a new paradigm in focus and organization for modeling the Earth System, bringing the country to the state-of-the-art in weather, climate, and environmental forecasting.

Speaker Bio: Saulo R. Freitas is a researcher specializing in meteorology and atmospheric sciences. He holds a D. Sc. in Applied Physics from the University of São Paulo. Additionally, he conducted postdoctoral research at the NASA Ames Research Center and served as a Visiting Researcher at the Earth System Laboratory Research (NOAA). Currently, he is a Senior Researcher and Professor in the Graduate Program in Meteorology at the Brazilian Institute for Space Research (INPE). His research focuses on air pollution and atmospheric chemistry associated with wildfires, convection parameterization, and numerical weather forecasting integrated with atmospheric chemistry and aerosols.
