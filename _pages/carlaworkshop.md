## This workshop is part of [Carla 2025 conference](https://carlaconference.org/)

### Introduction

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Extreme weather and climate hazard forecasting plays a fundamental role in mitigating climate risks across Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), a region disproportionately affected by climate change. Increasingly frequent hydrometeorological hazards‚Äîincluding extreme temperatures, droughts, storms, hurricanes, and floods, confirm the urgency of accurate information and predictive tools. However, historical challenges such as fragmented observational networks and limited regional collaboration have hampered progress in developing tailored forecasting models and leveraging high-performance computing (HPC) solutions for climate and atmospheric research.

In the meantime, the international community is moving from current-generation modeling tools (e.g., the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model) to next-generation models that can take advantage of modern HPC systems (e.g., the Model for Prediction Across Scales - Atmosphere (MPAS-A). Furthermore, as AI and ML advance their capabilities and are increasingly adopted, questions remain regarding the convergence between weather forecasting and these technologies.

### Scope

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;"> This workshop seeks to establish a collaborative platform for the LAC weather and climate community to address these gaps. It will bring together the community to discuss the strategic and technical future of weather forecasting. We will include presentations by invited speakers and peer-reviewed papers that will showcase advances in regional modeling, model adaptations and development, use or creation of new models, and the fostering of partnerships. An emphasis will be placed on integrating local climatic characteristics, such as ENSO-related variability, into predictive frameworks.
