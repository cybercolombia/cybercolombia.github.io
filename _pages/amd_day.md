# AMD DAY 2025: Parallel Computing Architectures and Programming Models for AI Applications

**Collocated with the 8th Colombian HPC Summer School** 

## Objective
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
The objective of this program is to introduce advanced students (ideally at the master’s and doctoral levels), researchers, faculty members, and professionals to parallel programming models and parallel computer architectures. The focus is on computing platforms (GPUs and NPUs) relevant to artificial intelligence (AI) applications.
</p>

## Date/Time
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
June 19, 2025\. 8:30 AM (COT) \- 5:00 PM (COT)
</p>

## Program Structure
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
The program consists of two technical sessions:
</p>

### Session 1: Neural Processing Unit (NPU) Programming for AI
<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
The Neural Processing Unit (NPU) in AMD Ryzen processors is an AI engine that utilizes AMD's XDNA architecture, designed to accelerate machine learning tasks. It's a dedicated processing unit that works alongside the main x86 CPU, offering improved performance and efficiency for AI-related workloads.
</p>

**Topics Covered**

* Introduction to NPU and AI Engine architecture  
* AIE core, array configuration, and host application code compilation  
* Data movement and communication abstraction layers  
* Performance tracing and monitoring  
* Practical examples, including matrix multiplication and convolutions, as foundational components for machine learning and computer vision applications

### Session 2: GPU Programming with HIP and ROCm

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
AMD’s Heterogeneous Compute Interface for Portability, or HIP, is a C++ runtime API and kernel language that allows developers to create portable applications that can run on AMD’s accelerators as well as CUDA devices.
</p>

**Topics Covered:**

* Overview of parallel programming models, AMD GPUs, and the ROCm platform  
* Structure of HIP code: API usage, grid hierarchy, and kernel definitions  
* Practical examples: matrix and vector addition  
* Use of streams to overlap kernel execution and data transfers  
* Migration of CUDA applications to HIP using `hipify` and `hipifly`
