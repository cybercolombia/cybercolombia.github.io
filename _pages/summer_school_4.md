> **Networking** Meet researchers and professionals from private and public sectors, as well as academia, from Latin America and the world.

> **International experts** Learn from and interact with international experts and leaders from a range of companies. Some of our supporters have included NVIDIA, AWS, MathWorks, National Labs including Argonne, OAK, Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center, and other renowned institutions

> **Hands-on** Participants will learn by constructive cooperation with other programmers from a variety of fields, under the guidance of worldwide recognized experts in the field.

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">This will be the fourth installment in a series of international schools, organized by Universidad del Rosario, Universidad de Los Andes, and the Earlham Institute. It is aimed at training students, researchers, and professionals from private and public sectors in optimal parallel programming for HPC environments with heterogeneous infrastructure, thus stimulating the use of these technologies in Latin America and the world.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">The school uses a hands-on approach, in which the participants will learn by developing parallel applications, presenting them with the opportunity for constructive cooperation with programmers from abroad as well as other fields of interest, under the guidance of worldwide recognized experts in the field.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Due to the current situation with covid-19, the summer school will be an online event to take place in Bogotá, from July 12th to 17th, 2021.</p>
