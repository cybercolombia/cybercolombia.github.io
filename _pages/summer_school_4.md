        **Nina Bogl (Amazon WebService HPC)**

        *Research Computing on AWS Made Easy!*

        AWS offers a vast number of resources and services, including an amazing amount of compute capacity, and a variety of architecture options, such that every researcher could have a supercomputer “at their fingertips”.

        However, the task of having to setup their own environment and needing “IT Skills” may seem daunting to many scientists and researchers.

        This presentation will demonstrate an easy way to use AWS tools and services to create an HPC cluster the way you need, when you need it. You will also learn how to setup your preferred application once, and use it every time you start a new cluster. In the AWS Cloud you can. experiment without fear!

        **George Thiruvathukal (Loyola University Chicago)**

        *Software Engineering in Scientific Computing*
        
        Scientific software is a special class of software that includes software developed to support various scientific endeavors that would be difficult, or impossible, to perform experimentally or without computational support. The development of scientific software differs significantly from the development of more traditional business information systems, from which many software engineering best practices and tools have been drawn.

        *Data Visualization at the NASA Advanced Supercomputing Division*
        
        The goal of data visualization is to provide further insight by rendering data in a manner that best leverages our visual perception capabilities.  In the Data Analysis and Visualization group within the NASA Advanced Supercomputing (NAS) Division at NASA Ames Research Center, we collaborate with the users of the NAS systems in the development of visualizations and tools that enable one to see and interrogate computing results in new and fruitful ways.  In this talk we will describe some of our work, the interesting challenges that we faced, and why we think visualization is cool.

# Welcome to the 4th HPC Summer School 2022 – Colombia

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Our Summer School provides a unique opportunity to attend state-of-the-art training delivered by world-leading academics and industry partners from around the globe, practicing hands-on exercises lead by renowned experts, and networking with your peers in an invaluable forum for knowledge exchange.</p>

> **Networking** Meet researchers and professionals from private and public sectors, as well as academia, from Latin America and the world.

> **International experts** Learn from and interact with international experts and leaders from a range of companies. Some of our supporters have included NVIDIA, AWS, MathWorks, National Labs including Argonne, OAK, Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center, and other renowned institutions

> **Hands-on** Participants will learn by constructive cooperation with other programmers from a variety of fields, under the guidance of worldwide recognized experts in the field.

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">This will be the fourth installment in a series of international schools, organized by Universidad del Rosario, Universidad de Los Andes, and the Earlham Institute. It is aimed at training students, researchers, and professionals from private and public sectors in optimal parallel programming for HPC environments with heterogeneous infrastructure, thus stimulating the use of these technologies in Latin America and the world.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">The school uses a hands-on approach, in which the participants will learn by developing parallel applications, presenting them with the opportunity for constructive cooperation with programmers from abroad as well as other fields of interest, under the guidance of worldwide recognized experts in the field.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Due to the current situation with covid-19, the summer school will be an online event to take place in Bogotá, from July 12th to 17th, 2021.</p>
