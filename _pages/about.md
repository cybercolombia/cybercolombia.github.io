**Guidelines for Using the CyberColombia Logo**

The CyberColombia logo is a vital part of our brand identity. To ensure consistent and proper usage across all platforms and media, please adhere to the following guidelines when using the CyberColombia logo.

---

**1. Logo Versions**

- **Primary Logo (Full Version with Text):**
  - This version of the logo, which includes both the "C" symbol and the "CyberColombia" text, should be used in all formal and public-facing communications (such as presentations, websites, and official documents). This is the most recognizable form of the logo.

- **Alternative Logos (Symbol Only or Monochrome Versions):**
  - The "C" symbol on its own may be used in specific contexts where the full logo is not necessary (e.g., app icons or social media profile images). This symbol should always maintain the same proportions as the full logo.
  - Monochrome (black or white) versions may be used when color printing is not available or when placed on dark or complex backgrounds to ensure clarity and legibility.

**2. Clear Space and Minimum Size**

- **Clear Space:**
  - Maintain a minimum clear space around the logo equal to the height of the "C" symbol in the logo. This space must be free of any other elements, text, or graphics to maintain clarity and visual impact.

- **Minimum Size:**
  - **Print:** The logo should not be reproduced smaller than 1 inch (2.5 cm) in width for the full logo or 0.5 inch (1.25 cm) for the "C" symbol alone.
  - **Digital:** The logo should not appear smaller than 100 pixels in width for the full logo and 50 pixels in width for the "C" symbol alone.

---

**3. Color Specifications**

- **Official Colors:**
  - **Blue Gradient:** Used primarily in the "C" symbol (RGB or HEX values should be specified if needed).
  - **Text Color:** The accompanying "CyberColombia" text should be a consistent shade of blue unless using a monochrome version.

- **Backgrounds:**
  - The logo should ideally be placed on a white or neutral background to maintain contrast. If a colored or dark background is used, ensure that the monochrome version is applied or that the background is sufficiently muted to maintain readability.

---

**4. Acceptable and Unacceptable Uses**

- **Acceptable Uses:**
  - Resizing the logo proportionally.
  - Using the logo in its original colors or monochrome versions.
  - Placing the logo on appropriate backgrounds with sufficient contrast.

- **Unacceptable Uses:**
  - **Do Not** alter the logo's colors outside the approved color palette.
  - **Do Not** stretch, distort, or modify the proportions of the logo or symbol.
  - **Do Not** apply additional effects (such as shadows, gradients, or 3D effects) unless explicitly approved.
  - **Do Not** enclose the logo in an unauthorized shape or combine it with other text or graphics.
  - **Do Not** place the logo on visually busy backgrounds or patterns that obscure the design.
  - **Do Not** crop or separate the "C" symbol from the text unless it is an approved alternate usage.

---

**5. Placement and Orientation**

- Always display the logo in its standard orientation (horizontal for the full logo).
- When placed alongside other logos (e.g., in partnerships or sponsorships), ensure the CyberColombia logo is given equal weight and size compared to others.

---

**6. Digital Usage**

- When using the logo in digital formats:
  - Ensure the logo is sharp and properly scaled for high-resolution displays.
  - Use alternative text (alt text) for accessibility purposes (e.g., "CyberColombia Logo").
  - If the logo is clickable, link it to the official CyberColombia website: [www.cybercolombia.org](https://www.cybercolombia.org).

---

**7. File Formats**

- **Print Materials:**  
  Use vector files (EPS, AI, SVG) to ensure the logo scales correctly without loss of quality.

- **Digital Materials:**  
  Use high-resolution PNG or JPEG files for digital use.

- **Requesting Files:**
