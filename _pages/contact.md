        **carlosedu.alvarez@urosario.edu.co**

        Biologist with a Master in Physics from Universidad de los Andes. Obtained his Ph.D. in Physics from Université Paris XI developing models on ferrofluids and charged colloids via molecular simulations. He did his post-doctoral stay in the Technische Universität of Berlín, where he worked on numerical simulations of magnetic nano-rods. He has worked with several parallel computing frameworks like OpenMP, MPI and Cuda. Currently, he is a Professor of the School of Engineering, Science and Technology at Universidad del Rosario – Bogotá.

        Jose Manuel Monsalve Diaz obtained his bachelor’s degree in Electrical Engineering from the Pontificia Universidad Javeriana in Bogotá in 2013, and his Master in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Delaware in 2020.  After graduation in 2013, he continued his studies at the University of Delaware where he is currently pursuing his PhD on the area of Parallel Computing Architectures. He is also a graduate researcher in Argonne National Laboratory since 2018. Throughout the years he has worked as a research assistant of the CAPSL research group for Prof Guang. R. Gao, and the CRPL research group for Prof. Sunita Chandrasekaran. His areas of interest are parallel computer architecture design, parallel computer systems and parallel programming models. He has worked on validation and verification of OpenMP target offloading, as well as with OpenACC programming targetting CPU and heterogeneous systems based on GPGPUs.

        **jp.mallarino50@uniandes.edu.co**

        Physicist from Universidad Nacional de Colombia, obtained my Ph.D. in Physics from Universidad de los Andes developing analytic models for stiff rod-like polyelectrolytes through molecular simulations. During my post-doctoral stay in Universidad de los Andes, we revised the Contact Theorem for the Cell Model and Manning condensation phenomenon for the two-dimensional one-component plasma. As of today, I am the HPC Coordinator and Researcher for the School of Sciences in Universidad de los Andes. I have a strong background on theoretical statistical mechanics, programming languages such as C/C++, Python, R and SQL, and Linux administration for cluster environments with application development and deployment.

        **jose.de-vega@earlham.ac.uk**

        Jose De Vega leads a research group at the Earlham Institute (Norwich, UK) focused on producing and integrating genomic and phenomic data from crops important to global food security. To do this, we collaborate with plant breeders, researchers and gene banks from other British institutes, CGIAR centers, and tropical countries. The Earlham Institute specializes in exploring genome diversity using sequencing technologies and data science in the fields of food security, health, and biodiversity conservation. In a global project with 20 institutions in Colombia and the United Kingdom financed by the British Government to increase human and technological resources for research in Colombia, called GROW Colombia (www.growcolombia.org), our work is to analyze genetic diversity in crops relevant to the Colombian economy.
