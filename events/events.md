### Recent Highlights (Late 2025)

#### 🚀 SC25: HPC Ignites
**St. Louis, Missouri | November 16–21, 2025**

We successfully concluded our participation in **SC25 (The International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage, and Analysis)**.
* **Theme:** *HPC Ignites*
* **Activity:** Our team engaged with the global community to discuss the future of supercomputing.
* **Key Focus:** We presented our latest publications and networked with industry leaders to bring new infrastructure opportunities to Colombia. The event served as a launchpad for new collaborations in hybrid CPU-QPU architectures.

#### 🇯🇲 CARLA 2025
**Kingston, Jamaica | September 22–26, 2025**

CyberColombia played a key role in the **Latin America High Performance Computing Conference (CARLA 2025)**, held for the first time in the Caribbean.
* **Leadership:** **Dr. Jose M. Monsalve Diaz** (CyberColombia) served as a key organizer and speaker in the workshop tracks.
* **Workshops:** We co-led sessions on *"HPC Centers Around the World"*, discussing science and computing perspectives specifically for the Latin American and Caribbean community.
* **Impact:** This event strengthened ties between Colombian researchers and the broader Caribbean scientific ecosystem.

#### 📊 International Data Events & Global MIL Week
**Cartagena, Colombia | October 2025**

CyberColombia was active during the **UNESCO Global Media and Information Literacy (MIL) Week 2025**, hosted in Cartagena.
* **Theme:** *Minds over AI – MIL in Digital Spaces*
* **Our Contribution:** As advocates for responsible AI and data science, we participated in dialogues regarding the intersection of High-Performance Computing and AI ethics. We emphasized the importance of "Data for Positive Change," aligning with global conversations from **International Data Week (IDW 2025)** in Brisbane.
