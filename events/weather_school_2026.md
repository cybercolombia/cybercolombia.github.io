## About the Event
CyberColombia is proud to present an intensive 4-day training school focused on the next generation of weather prediction models. This event bridges the gap between traditional forecasting (WRF) and the future of multi-scale unstructured mesh modeling (MPAS).

Designed for researchers, meteorologists, and HPC engineers, this course will cover the complete workflow from installation to advanced post-processing, with a strong emphasis on the interoperability between WRF and MPAS.

## Prerequisites
To ensure a productive environment, participants are expected to meet the following requirements before attending:

### Academic Background
* **Meteorology Fundamentals:** Solid understanding of atmospheric dynamics and physics.
* **Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP):** Conceptual familiarity with numerical modeling principles (primitive equations, discretization, parameterizations).
* **Linux/Unix Environment:** Intermediate command-line skills (shell scripting, navigation, text editing with vi/nano).
* **Programming (Recommended):** Basic reading knowledge of Fortran 90 and C is helpful for understanding code structure.
