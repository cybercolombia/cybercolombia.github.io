# Vision and Context

**CyberColombia** was created to strengthen regional capabilities in **scientific computing, high-performance computing (HPC), and artificial intelligence**, fostering effective collaboration between academia, industry, and the public sector. Our vision is direct and pragmatic: **to narrow the gap between scientific ambition and actual computational capability** by developing human capital that understands both the scientific problem and the constraints of modern computational infrastructures.

Technology, in our approach, is not an end in itself but an enabler. For this reason, all CyberColombia training activities are designed to deliver **practical, transferable capabilities**, grounded in real systems and real workloads, and to promote a critical and sustainable adoption of advanced technologies.


## Track Record and Prior Experience

CyberColombia’s work is built upon sustained experience in training and international collaboration, including:

* **Specialized workshops in weather and climate forecasting**, with a strong focus on numerical modeling using WRF, addressing both the physical foundations of the models and the computational challenges associated with high-resolution simulations on HPC platforms.
* **Technical and academic support for international HPC workshops**, in collaboration with scientific communities and leading computing centers across Latin America, the United States, and Europe.

Through this trajectory, a recurring challenge has become evident: many research groups operate advanced models and generate high-quality data, yet lack the computational expertise required to scale, optimize, and operate these solutions efficiently and sustainably.

## Introduction to the Workshop Series

The **CyberColombia Workshop Series** is designed to address this gap. It consists of a structured set of technical, modular, and progressive workshops aimed at:

* Researchers, graduate students, and technical professionals.
* Teams working in scientific simulation, data analytics, artificial intelligence, and complex computational systems.
* Institutions seeking to build internal computational capacity without long-term dependence on external providers.

Each workshop combines:

* **Scientific and computational foundations**, presented with technical rigor.
* **Hands-on sessions**, where participants work with real software stacks, real datasets, and real computing environments (local, institutional, or cloud-based).
* **Critical technical discussion**, focused on architectural choices, performance trade-offs, energy efficiency, cost, and scalability.

The series covers topics spanning HPC, numerical modeling, data science, AI for scientific applications, emerging architectures, and reproducible computational workflows. The objective is not to offer simplistic solutions, but to provide **sound technical judgment, solid training, and a realistic understanding of what current technologies can and cannot deliver**.

At CyberColombia, workshops are conceived as **entry points to an active technical community**, where learning extends beyond the event itself and evolves into collaboration, shared projects, and sustained capacity building.
